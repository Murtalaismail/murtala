<center><h2>Sell on marketplaces</h2></center>

<center>3. Amazon</center>
Amazon is undoubtedly a reliable and go-to website that attracts more than 20.6 million people each month. Selling on Amazon automatically creates a sense of trust and comfort for your customers. Besides, such a huge number of visitors means that your items are more likely to be seen.
<br>

Anyone that sells almost anything will be able to manage a business on Amazon. You just have to be sure that your price range is competitive enough to be a contender without sacrificing a lot of your profit margins. If you’re a small business owner, it might be a little bit more challenging, as others are selling in large quantities, making pricing very competitive.

<center><h3>Amazon’s price:</h3></center>

Individual: $0.99/ item sold plus additional selling fees. This plan will be appropriate for you if you sell less than 40 items per month.
Professional. $39.99/ month plus additional selling fees. This will become your best option if you sell more than 40 items a month.

        <h2>[ truhst baj ] Noun       Trust Badge
        
        
          1. An emblem that instills trust in prospective customers.
       <br><br> Trust badges—touting a website's security, guarantees, return policies and more—are an essential element of the checkout process for e-commerce sites

<br><br><br>When your e-commerce website doesn’t display trustmarks or trust seals, it will often lead potential buyers to abandon your site—and in many cases, never come back.

Use these free, downloadable trust badges to establish trust, decrease abandoned carts and increase conversions.

 Diversify your shipping strategy
A whopping 96% of customers now expect free shipping, and 26% are likely to discard a shopping cart if shipping is too slow.

Without a reasonable way to ship on these demands, fulfillment costs could take up a large number of your profits. 
So, it’s essential to access the most competitive carrier pricing and shipping choices.

A combination of various methods can make sure the fastest and most economical choice for each order. 
In this situation, you can take advantage of private carriers like FedEx and UPS for some orders, and USPS for others.
